# Here we will learn about the join function 

li = ["shahnawaz" , "hamza" , "reeta" , "john"]

# for item in li:
#     print(item , "and" , end=" ")
    



# The work done by above code can also be done by join function as :

a = " and ".join(li)
print(a , "other superstars")

b = " is here ".join(li)
print(b , "hello all")
